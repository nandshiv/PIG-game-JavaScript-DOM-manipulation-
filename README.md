This is a simple yet engaging 2-player dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game follows the classic **Pig Game** rules where players take turns to roll a dice and accumulate points. If a player rolls a 1, they lose the turn. The first to reach the target score wins!

- On each turn, a player rolls a die:
  - If the roll is **not 1**, the number is added to their **current score**.
  - If the roll is **1**, their **current score resets** and the turn passes to the next player.
- A player can **"Hold"** to add the current score to their **total score** and end their turn.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.
